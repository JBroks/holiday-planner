## Deployment

The site was developed using AWS Cloud 9. To keep records of different versions of all project files git version control system was used. 

In order to track the changes in the local repository the following steps were taken:

- command `git add 'filename'` - to update what will be committed;

- command `git commit` - to commit the changes.

Using `git push` command all changes from the local repository were pushed to the remote one on GitHub.


This project is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the `master` branch. 

To deploy my project from GitHub I followed these steps:

1. On GitHub website I logged onto my account and navigated to [my repository](https://github.com/JBroks/holiday-planner);

2. Under my repository name, I clicked on **Settings** tab;

3. I scrolled down to the **GitHub Pages** section;

4. On the **Select source** drop-down menu I selected `master` as my GitHub Pages publishing source;

5. I clicked **Save**.

The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the `master` branch. It is important to remember that for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named `index.html`.

In order to clone my GitHub repository to your local one you should follow these steps:

1. On GitHub navigate to [my repository](https://github.com/JBroks/holiday-planner);

2. Under the repository name, click **Clone or download**;

3. In the Clone with HTTPs section, copy the clone URL for the repository;

4. Go to IDE that you are using and open terminal;

5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made;

6. Type `git clone` and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3;

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JBroks/holiday-planner.git
```

7. Lastly press **Enter** and your local repository will be created.
