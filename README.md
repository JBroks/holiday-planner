# Holiday Planner

Stream Two Project: Interactive Frontend Development - extra credit project.

![alt text](https://github.com/JBroks/holiday-planner/blob/master/gif/holidayPlanner.gif "Gif")

This website uses Google Maps API to create a holiday planner tool that will enable its user to filter out place types (accommodation, restaurant, tourist attractions) by country and city.

Project consists of the following sections:

1. Filters - contains two select menus to specify country and place type (accommodation, restaurant, tourist attraction), and input window that enables a user to specify the city of their choice.

2. Map - section contains Google Maps API map that contains markers pointing to places narrowed down by applied filters.

3. Results - section contains a table that presents the same outputs as the map but in tabular form. Section stays hidden if selection has not been made.

## Demo

Website demo is available [here](https://jbroks.github.io/holiday-planner/ "holiday-planner").

## UX

### UX Design

In this project I was aiming to achieve a simple and user friendly user design, while providing all required information. All sections are arranged in a logical order to provide intuitive user experience.

To create stylish, high contrast look I used the following colors in my design: white (`#ffffff`), off-white (`#f6f7f6`), light-green (`#00bc66`), dark-green (`#00703c`) and range of grey / dark-grey colors (`#222222`, `#9d9d9d`, `#333333`, `#474b4e`).

High contrast theme gives an addiional advantage for low-vision users as it is makes it easier for them to read. 

### Target Audience

This website aims to attract people that are planning their holidays and would like to find most suitable place to visit. It informs its user about accommodation and restaurant choice in the selected area. The website also provides them with information about local tourist attractions.

The main objective of the website is to provide a user with a tool that will enable them to filter out accommodation / restaurants / tourist attraction inforamtion based on a destination specified by them.

### User Stories

The following user stories were used to design this project:

**User Story 1:** As a user I would like to explore different holliday destination options so I can decide which one is the most suitable for me.

**User Story 2:** As a user I would like to understand what any destination has to offer i.e. what sort of accommodation, restaurants and / or tourists attractions are available in the area specified by me.

**User Story 3:** As a user I would like to be able to investigate any type of place (accommodation / restaurants / tourist attraction) in more detail so I am aware what are e.g. opening times, contact details and reservation requirements.

**User Story 4:** As a user I would like to have a quick way to clear all filters applied by me without refreshing the page.

**User Story 5:** As a user I would like to have an option of easy navigation throughtout the page without scrolling back and forth all the time.

**User Story 6:** As a user I would like to be informed if I am doing anythig wrong to understand how can I fix my error.

### Mockups & Wireframes

The following [wireframe](https://github.com/JBroks/holiday-planner/blob/master/wireframes/wireframes.pdf) sketches were created to design the dashboard layout options for large, medium and mobile displays.

## Features

### Existing Features

### Features left to implement

List of features to be implemented in the future:

- jQuery UI selectmenu feature to improve visual effect of the country and place type select list;

- Photos of places and opening hours added to information window;

- Information such as contact details, website, reviews added to the results table;

- Photo carouselle for the selected place to be displayed or a window presenting reviews for selected place.

## Technologies used

### Programming languages

- **HTML** - The project used HTML to define structure and layout of the web page;

- **CSS** - The project used CSS stylesheets to specify style of the web document elements;

- **JavaScript** - The project used Javascript to implement Maps Javascript API and customize it.

### Libraries

- [jQuery](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js) - The project used `show()` and `hide()` method to display loading spinner. jQuery was also used to fix the bootstrap menu issue (not collapsing after clicking a link) and to clear results section heading after clicking the reset button;

- [Sweetalert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/#download) - It was used to create customizable alert pop up boxes;

- [Font Awesome](https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css) - Font Awesome social media and navbar menu icons were used for the project;

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) -  Google Fonts library was used to set up font type for the document;

### Frameworks

- [Bootstrap]() - The project used Bootstrap to create nice grid layout, and position elements within grids. The framework was also used to create and customize the navbar element;

### Other

- [Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) - It was used to implement map feature on the website;

- [Places Library](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places) - Library was used to enable search for places within the specified area and to implement autocomplete feature;

- [Gifox](https://gifox.io/) - Tool was used to record the gif presented in the demo secion of this README files;

- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) - Online tool was used to display the project on various devices;

- [Free Logo Design](https://www.freelogodesign.org/) - Online tool that was used to create a logo for the website;

- [MockFlow WireframePro](https://www.mockflow.com/) - Online tool that was used to create wireframes.

## Testing

### Code validation

#### CSS

CSS code was validated using the [W3C CSS Validation Service - Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

While validating CSS code the following warning appeared: 

```
Imported style sheets are not checked in direct input and file upload modes
```

This warning remains unresolved as it is only an information stating that validator is not able to validate imported stylesheets.

Also, the following warning appeared during the CSS validation:

```
-webkit-border-radius is an unknown vendor extension
-webkit-appearance is an unknown vendor extension
-moz-appearance is an unknown vendor extension
```

This vendor extension is used to edit select menu button look so it does not display default arrows and does not round edges. This will be improved in the future and replaced by use of the **jQuery UI** `selectmenu` feature (description available [here](https://jqueryui.com/selectmenu/)).

#### HTML

HTML code was validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).

All errors and warning were addressed except the following:

```
Warning: Empty heading.

From line 181, column 21; to line 181, column 45

          <h2 id="results-heading"></h2>â†©
```

Warning about empty heading was left unresolved as it is set up like that on purpose. Heading is filled when the results table is created.

#### JavaScript

JavaScript code was validated using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/).

Validator has indicated that there are three unknown / undefined variables, namely `$`, `Swal`, `google`. The warning was ignored as I believe it is due to the fact that these libraries are separated and the validator dose not have access to them.

### Features testing

#### Spinner

##### Bugs:

No bugs noticed.

#### Navbar

While testing the navbar it was noticed that after clicking an item on the list the menu was not collapsing. This issue was resolved using the solution available [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21203111/bootstrap-3-collapsed-menu-doesnt-close-on-click).

This jQuery function was implemented to resolve the problem:

```
$(".navbar-nav li a").click(function(event) {
  if (!$(this).parent().hasClass('dropdown'))
    $(".navbar-collapse").collapse('hide');
});
```

Another bug was discovered when testing anchors for navbar menu items. When clicking on an item it was scrolling to a given section but the fixed navbar covered the content (i.e. the section heading). Solution to this problem was found [here](https://css-tricks.com/fixed-headers-on-page-links-and-overlapping-content-oh-my/). The issue was fixed by applying `scroll-padding-top`, to `body` and `html` elements, equal to the height of the navbar. This solution works for most of browsers except Safari.

##### Bugs:

There is still one bug that needs to be resolved, namely if a user clicks on the navbar menu the list unfolds, and in the case when no item is selected the list does not collapse back until any item (on the page) is clicked.

As mentioned above Safari browser does not react to `scroll-padding-top` therefore alternative solutions needs to be found.

#### Select menu and Autocomplete input window

While testing place type select menu an error was noticed. Since *default* place type option was undefined error was displayed in the console. The issue was resolved by adding a function that assumed if *default* option is selected no marker will be dropped:

```
function onDefaultType() {
    let option = document.getElementById('place-type').value;
    if (option != 'default') {
        search();
    }
}
```

Also in case when no country or city was specified markers were dropped anyway. This issue was resolved by implementing missing information alerts. This issue was resolved by the following function:

```
function typeWithoutPlace() {
    let city = document.getElementById('city-input').value;
    let countrySelect = document.getElementById('country').value;

    if (countrySelect == 'default' && city == '') {
        Swal.fire('Information missing', 'Please select a country and enter a city name first!', 'info');
        clearPlaceTypeSelection();
    }
    else if (countrySelect != 'default' && city == '') {
        Swal.fire('Information missing', 'Please enter a city name first!', 'info');
        clearPlaceTypeSelection();
    }
    else {
        search();
    }
}
```

##### Bugs:

No bug was left unresolved.

#### Reset button

There was an issue with the *reset section* as the bootstrap container fluid class applied was leaving a blank space on the right side of the page. Solution to this issue was found in [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34828198/container-fluid-leaving-blank-space).
This block of code resolved the problem:

```
.container-fluid {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    overflow: hidden;
}
```

##### Bugs:

No unresolved bugs.

#### Map

##### Bugs:

No bugs noticed.

#### Information window

##### Bugs:

No bugs noticed.

#### Results table

There was an issue with heading for the *results table*, namely it was not cleared after reset function was applied. Initially this piece of code was tested:

```
$('#results-heading').innerHTML("");
```

However it did not work properly so this jQuery function method was applied:

``` 
$('#results-heading').empty();
```

##### Bugs:

No unresolved bugs.

#### Footer

All links were tested and working well.

##### Bugs:

No bugs noticed.

#### Back to top button

##### Bugs:

While testing this button on mobile devices 'sticky' hover effect was noticed. That issue was resolved using `@media (hover: hover)` solution.

This solution will have to be replaced with a better one in the future, ideally with one that will resolve this issue for all buttons.

#### Missing information alert

##### Bugs:

No bugs noticed.

## Deployment

The site was developed using AWS Cloud 9. To keep records of different versions of all project files git version control system was used. 

In order to track the changes in the local repository the following steps were taken:

- command `git add 'filename'` - to update what will be committed;

- command `git commit` - to commit the changes.

Using `git push` command all changes from the local repository were pushed to the remote one on GitHub.


This project is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the `master` branch. 

To deploy my project from GitHub I followed these steps:

1. On GitHub website I logged onto my account and navigated to [my repository](https://github.com/JBroks/holiday-planner);

2. Under my repository name, I clicked on **Settings** tab;

3. I scrolled down to the **GitHub Pages** section;

4. On the **Select source** drop-down menu I selected `master` as my GitHub Pages publishing source;

5. I clicked **Save**.

The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the `master` branch. It is important to remember that for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named `index.html`.

In order to clone my GitHub repository to your local one you should follow these steps:

1. On GitHub navigate to [my repository](https://github.com/JBroks/holiday-planner);

2. Under the repository name, click **Clone or download**;

3. In the Clone with HTTPs section, copy the clone URL for the repository;

4. Go to IDE that you are using and open terminal;

5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made;

6. Type `git clone` and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3;

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JBroks/holiday-planner.git
```

7. Lastly press **Enter** and your local repository will be created.
